# DIY_T12_iron  

This repository conatins all the files for the DIY soldering iron which is compatible with hakko 936 style station and is meant to be used as the replacement PCB for HAKKO 936 style clones. This can support HAKKO T12 irons, HAKKO A1560(hakko 936 station) style irons as well as JBC c245 iron(yet to be checked).
